I am playing with Python for the first time. The syntax seems to be so natural. So many modules (numpy, scipy and matplotlib) for researchers/scientists. Cannot see any shortcoming at this point. Perhaps need more testing and implementation.

Some questions I am looking answers for: Is it faster than Fortran? If not faster, can it do everything Matlab does, such as availability of host of toolboxes?
