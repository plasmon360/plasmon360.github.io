I like the color schemes that are used as [palettes in gnuplot's pm3d plots](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/pm3dcolors.html). I wanted similar color schemes that can be used as colormaps in matlab.

After reading this [article](http://gnuplot-tricks.blogspot.com/2009/06/comment-on-phonged-surfaces-in-gnuplot.html), I found that  one can easily incorporate the traditional rgbpallette schemes in matlab

To start, there are several schemes in gnuplot  that can be used in pm3d plots and they are:

    7,5,15   ... traditional pm3d (black-blue-red-yellow)
    3,11,6   ... green-red-violet
    23,28,3  ... ocean (green-blue-white); try also all other permutations
    21,22,23 ... hot (black-red-yellow-white)
    30,31,32 ... color printable on gray (black-blue-violet-yellow-white)
    33,13,10 ... rainbow (blue-green-yellow-red)
    34,35,36 ... AFM hot (black-red-yellow-white)

The numbers represent different mapping functions for red, green and blue and the functions are

    0: 0               1: 0.5             2: 1
    3: x               4: x^2             5: x^3
    6: x^4             7: sqrt(x)         8: sqrt(sqrt(x))
    9: sin(90x)       10: cos(90x)       11: |x-0.5|
    12: (2x-1)^2       13: sin(180x)      14: |cos(180x)|
    15: sin(360x)      16: cos(360x)      17: |sin(360x)|
    18: |cos(360x)|    19: |sin(720x)|    20: |cos(720x)|
    21: 3x             22: 3x-1           23: 3x-2
    24: |3x-1|         25: |3x-2|         26: (3x-1)/2
    27: (3x-2)/2       28: |(3x-1)/2|     29: |(3x-2)/2|
    30: x/0.32-0.78125 31: 2*x-0.84       32: 4x;1;-2x+1.84;x/0.08-11.5
    33: |2*x - 0.5|    34: 2*x            35: 2*x - 0.5
    36: 2*x - 1
    * negative numbers mean inverted=negative colour component
    * thus the ranges in `set pm3d rgbformulae' are -36..36

For example, if we choose, 7,5,15 , ie, traditional pm3d (black-blue-red-yellow), the three numbers correspond to functions used for red, green and blue respectively. So in this case, red(x)=sqrt(x), green(x)=x\^3 and blue(x)=sin(2\*pi\*x), where x has range from 0 to 1. Note that red(x)/green(x)/blue(x) should not be negative numbers, so if they are negative make then zeros.

With that knowledge, here is a matlab code that creates 7,5,15 and 3,11,6 colormaps and uses it in the display of an image.  
\[cc lang='matlab'\]  
clear all  
x=linspace(0,1,128);  
r = sqrt(x);  
g = x.\^3.0;  
b=sin(x\*2\*pi);  
b(b&lt;0)=0;  
pm3d7515\_bbry=\[r;g;b\]'  
figure  
load mandrill;  
imagesc(X);  
colormap(pm3d7515\_bbry);  
colorbar

r = x;  
g = abs(x-0.5);  
b=x.\^4;  
pm3d3116\_grv=\[r;g;b\]'  
figure  
load mandrill;  
imagesc(X);  
colormap(pm3d3116\_grv);  
colorbar

\[/cc\]

This results are shown below. Other color schemes can be similarly incorporated into matlab codes.
