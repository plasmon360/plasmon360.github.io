The collective motions induced by oxidation and reduction of ![](http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/entities/223C.gif)8 billion muscle molecules are harnessed to perform mechanical work on a microcantilevers. The use of the cooperative forces generated by these self-assembled, nanometer-scale artificial molecular muscles that are electrically wired to an external power supply constitutes a seminal step toward molecular-machine-based nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). This work of ours is reported in issue 3 of ACS Nano journal.Â  Article can be downloaded from my publications page.
