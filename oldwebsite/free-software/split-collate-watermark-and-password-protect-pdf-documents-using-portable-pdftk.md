To split, collate, watermark and password protect pdf documents, I use pdftk portable app. pdftk is one of numerous applications that come withÂ  PortableApps.com free software. This platform can be installed on any portable USB drive and can be run on any computer without administrative privileges. More information can be found[here](http://portableapps.com/) and [here](http://portableapps.com/apps/office/pdftk_builder_portable). A screen shots of portable apps and pdftk are shown below:
