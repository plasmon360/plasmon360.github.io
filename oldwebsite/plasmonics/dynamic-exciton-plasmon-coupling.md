Our paper titled "Dynamically Tuning Plasmon-Exciton Coupling in Arrays of Nanodisk-J-aggregate Complexes" has been accepted as front cover image of [Advanced Materials](www.advmat.de) .

In this work, we demonstrated the dynamic tuning of plasmon-exciton resonant coupling in arrays of nanodiskâ€“J-aggregate complexes. The angle-resolved spectra of an array of bare Au nanodisks exhibited continuous shifting of localized surface plasmon resonances and this characteristic enabled the production of real-time, controllable spectral overlaps between molecular resonance and plasmonic resonance. In this work we explored resonant interaction strength as a function of spectral overlap. In experiments where we changed the incident angle of a probe light, the coupling strength changed; this result matched with the simulated data based on a coupled dipole approximation method.

Our method provides a platform to understand the interaction between LSPR and other optical properties of molecules such as fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, which require precise control of the overlap between the LSPR and the excitation or emission wavelengths. An understanding of these interactions will enable optimization of metal nanoparticle-molecule complexes and have a impact on many applications such as active nanophotonic devices, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and biosensors.
