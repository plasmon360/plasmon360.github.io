<p>I have been interested in monitoring and keep track of my weight. In the past,
I have used different phone apps to track my weight. They work reasonably well,
but I was thinking of reading weight data directly from my weighing scale and
upload the data to an online database. </p>
<p>It meant that I needed a micro-controller connect to my house WIFI connection
and upload that data to somewhere in the cloud. I have seen some projects
online that use an arduino for this purpose. They use arduino to serially send
information to computer. The information on the computer can be potentially
sent to an online database. One could also upload data directly from arduino to
internet using a wifi shield, but this makes it more expensive. I was therefore
more inclined towards Raspberry pi because it connects to wifi easily and can
read data from weighing scale. I was also inclined in programming in python on
raspberry pi rather than C, which I am not very proficient.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of weighing scale</strong></p>
<p>I looked around some projects online and <a href="http://fivevolt.blogspot.com/2011/01/hacking-scale-to-add-zigbee-goodness.html">found a
weighing scale</a>
that seemed easy to get data from by reading the LED signals. I bought the same
model for around 20 bucks at my local target. The first thing I noticed after
opening this scale was that it did not look similar to what was described at
fivevolt blog. I did not see the four transistors and HC164 of which the author
talks about in his blog. May be the manufacturer changed the design or they
have different versions of it. I was disappointed.</p>
<p>The PCB on the weighing scale had a epoxy covered region, which I presume is
the microcontroller and it is connected to a big chip on the board. I looked at
the name of the big chip on the pcb board and I can barely read TM1628. A
simple google search revealed that it was an LED controller for the led
display. The led display has four grids (digits). Each of this digit is a 8
segment display. TM1628 controls which grids and segments were to be lit or
not (HI or LOW). So I can see 12 wires going from LED controller to LED
display (four for controlling each grid and eight for the 7 segment display of each grid). I could figure out
which wires correspond to which grid and which segment and tried to solder
wires. But that meant I have to read 12 digital signals (Hi or Low) using
raspberry pi GPIO. This also looks very ugly too. So I decided to take a
different route instead.</p>
<p><strong> Understanding how data was being processed inside</strong></p>
<p>A close inspection revealed that the microcontroller onboard was sending
instructions to TM1628 using SPI protocol. So I intercepted these SPI specific voltage pulses
(3.3V) using Raspberry Pi as shown in figure below. </p>
<p>SPI bus consists of master
and slave and has four lines in between them, which are MOSI, MISO, SCLK and SS
(for more information see <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi">here</a>.  In this
case, the TM1628 is the slave and the microcontroller on board is the master.
The slave does not send any data to the microcontroller so there is no MISO
line. SCLK is the clock signal. MOSI and SS line are referred as DIO and STB
respectively in the TM1628 manual.</p>
<p>Schematic of the hacked weighing scale</p>
<p><img alt="" class="center" src="/images/weighing_scale_schematic.png"></p>
<p>After intercepting the STB, SCLK and DIO with raspberry pi as shown in the
above figure (used bitscope package to read these signals). A typical pattern looks
like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="center" src="/images/weighing_scale_oscilloscope_1.png"></p>
<p>Each green line in the DIO contains data that is synced to STB and SCLK. When I
zoom on the each green line I see the following:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="center" src="/images/weighing_scale_oscilloscope_2.png"></p>
<p>Bits of data are being sent out in the DIO line at the rising edge of the clock
signal.To decode these bytes.</p>
<p>When I just step on the weighing scale and get down, weighing scale displayed
“0.0” for some time and then the display turns off. I was able to get the bytes
for this action and start to decode according to the TM1628 manual. Below are
the bytes being sent and the decoded information for the action of just
stepping on and stepping of the weighing scale.</p>
<p>The order in which bytes are sent is shown below:
<img alt="" class="center" src="/images/weighing_scale_bytes_sent.png"></p>
<p>Command 1 and command 2 prepare the display. Command 3 helps in preparing the
grid/digit. It can be seen from the above figure, once a grid is prepared, a
character is being written to that grid/digit. This process starts from the
first grid and ends at the fifth grid. This cycle repeats many times. The cycle
repeats so fast that we think the display is not changing.  I used the
following cheat sheets for decoding the above data bytes. </p>
<p>Following table is for command 3 where a certain grid/digit has to being chosen.</p>

<p>Following table shows the bytes for displaying a certain character on a certain
grid/digit.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="center" src="/images/weighing_scale_segement_char.png"></p>
<p><strong> Code to capture the data </strong></p>
<p>Once I understood the commands being sent and how to interpret them, I wrote a
python code that uses <a href="http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/python.html">PIGPIO</a> to
read these commands. </p>

source code for this project at <a href =

<p>I also added the capability to select a user with a rotary switch and assign weight information. A user can be guest, myself or my wife.</p>
<p>Weight information is written to a file locally and also uploads the information to plotly for visualization.</p>

integration)  </p>
