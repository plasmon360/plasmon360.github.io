</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>My current apartment does not have a doorbell (Its strange but it is true). I went ahead and built a doorbell using two arduino pro-minis and two NRF24L01 transceivers. The melody to be played when a guest presses a button can also be controlled. I have four melodies programmed in.</p>
<p>Here it is in full action:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOZX-KPf5XA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Here are some details:</p>
<p><strong>Remote</strong> </p>
<p>The schematic for the remote is shown below. The remote is configured to run on 2 AAA batteries and goes to sleep mode most of the time and then wakes up when a guest presses the button. This button press is transmitted to an NRF24L01 receiver on the doorbell by a NRF24L01 tranmisster. I decreased the overall current to 65 microA by removing the LED on the arduino pro mini and used <a href="https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power">rocket</a> library's sleep functions. This arduino pro mini was running at 3.3V and 8 MHz. Could have gone even further in current reduction by removing the board regulator, but I was happy with 65 microAmps. For AAA batteries, assuming 1000 mAh capacity, it should last around 20 months.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the remote. I enclosed it in a eye wear case, which turned out to be a nice enclosure.</p>

<p><strong>Doorbell</strong>  </p>
<p>The schematic for the doorbell is shown below. This circuit is powered by 9V adapter from AC mains, which is Â converted to a 5V and 3.3V by <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/ICSA009A-Stable-Step-Down-Power-Supply-Module-3-3V-5V-for-MB-102-Breadboard-/221584526129">ICSA009</a> breadboard adapter. I use 3.3V to power the arduino pro-mini and NRF2L01 receiver. Other than that, nothing fancy here, but I have four doorbell melodies on the arduino that can be chosen with a DIP switch. </p>
<p>Connecting buzzer directly to the arduino resulted in very less volume since arduino could source much current, so I connected it to 5V supply with 2N3409 transitor. <a href="http://bryanduxbury.com/2012/01/20/one-transistor-audio-amplifier-for-arduino-projects/">The base of the transistor is controlled by an arduino pin in series with a 100 ohm resistor</a>. I placed the whole breadboard into a food storage container as a case.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of the final prototype.</p>

<strong> Note :</strong> You can find my code at my <a href = "https://github.com/plasmon360/Arduino_NRF24L01_Doorbell_project"> github account</a>.

The same code should be uploaded to both remote and doorbell arduino's.
