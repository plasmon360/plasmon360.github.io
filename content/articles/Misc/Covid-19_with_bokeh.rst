:summary: Visualizing Covid-19 cases in San Diego by zip code using Bokeh

- Data is obtained from `San Diego County <https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/Epidemiology/COVID-19%20Summary%20of%20Cases%20by%20Zip%20Code.pdf>`_
- Visualizations are generated by the procedure shown at `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/plasmon360/COVID-19-in-SanDiego/blob/master/Bokeh_Covid19_visualization.ipynb>`_ 

- These Visualization get updated if the County updates their PDF source. For more details on the motivation of the project and visualuzation pipeline.
