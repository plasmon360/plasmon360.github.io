For my doorbell project, I needed some melodies to be played on arduino. One can takes notes of a melody and write a corresponding arduino code.

I like airtel tune and wanted to play it with arduino. I got the notes fromÂ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5j5UIRqQc

Here is the final result, where I use it in my doorbell project.
