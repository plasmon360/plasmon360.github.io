Inspired by the [article on speaker cables](http://www.audioholics.com/gadget-reviews/diy-speaker-cable-faceoff/diy-cable-faceoff-results-and-conclusion), I built the CAT5 V3 version of the speaker cable. Following are the images of how I made them. I have access to a precise LCR meter and will measure R, L and C as function of frequencies shortly. The capacitance of the cat5 speaker cables is known to be high.
