Optical power meters in-conjunction with a detector are used to measure power from a laser source or monochromatic output. 

At work, we use [Newport 1918](http://www.newport.com/Optical-Power-Meter-High-Performance-Hand-Held-19/509478/1033/info.aspx "Newport 1918") power meter. This power meter comes with its own [software](http://www.newport.com/Optical-Power-Meter-High-Performance-Hand-Held-19/509478/1033/info.aspx#tab_Literature "software"). However,Â I was interested in controlling this instrument with python. 


I wrote a python module for communicating with this instrument. This python module contains higher level functions to communicate with [Newport 1918 power meter](http://www.newport.com/1918-R-HandHeld-Optical-Power-and-Energy-Meter/509478/1033/info.aspx#tab_Overview) on a Windows computer. It uses python library ctypes to access methods in the Newport's usbdll.dll driver.
