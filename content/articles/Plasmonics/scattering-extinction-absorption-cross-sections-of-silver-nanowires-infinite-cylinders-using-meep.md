Particles scatter and absorb electromagnetic radiation. One often needs to compare the amount of scattering/absorption/extinction for particles of different shapes, composition, sizes and incident light properties (polarization, frequency and angle). In this regard, the concept of cross-sections comes into picture. There are three types of cross-sections, 1) scattering 2) absorption and 3) extinction. All of them have units of area, \$m\^2\$, and provide a measure to quantify scattering/absorption process. Here using MEEP I calculate the crossections of silver nanowires and compare them with numerical solution ([code from Bohren and Hauffman book](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527618156.app4/pdf)).

To achieve this, I wrote a meep code that performs a 2D simulation (x-y) with the cylinder axis along z axis with sources and monitors places as shown below. The source is a line source which travels along y direction and has polarization with electric field along x axis (along radius). I also use mirror-symmetries anti-symetry along X direction (which reduces the simulation time by half). PML layers are used on all sides. Calculation of cross-sections involves creating multiple 1-d flux monitors and running multiple simulations as shown below.

[Here is my project file.](http://juluribk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/silver_cylinder_gray_comp_no_fft.zip). You would need ubuntu like system with meep and octave installed. Shell script will do all the work.

I have also shared the [project at github.](https://github.com/juluribk/Meep_cylinder_scattering_project)
