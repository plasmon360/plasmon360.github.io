These are some resources on Electromagnetics/plasmonics/nanophotonics

I will maintain a list of free resources on electromagnetics, plasmonics, nanophotonics, optics and other related topics here. If any of you (readers) know any other free resources related to this topic, please let me know and I can add into these lists.

Free books:

1.  [Electromagnetic waves and Antennas](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/) by Prof. Sophocles J. Orfanidis

2.  Surface plasmons by Smooth and Rough surfaces by Heinz Raether (Note: This book is hosted by Prof. Shalaev's on [Nanophotonics & Metamaterials course website](http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~ece695s/)).

3.  Photonic Crystals:Molding the Flow of Light by John D. Joannopoulos, Steven G. Johnson, Joshua N. Winn, and Robert D. Meade. This can be downloaded from [their website](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book/).  This book is must for anyone interested in photonic crystals and for serious readers, purchasing the book is definitely worth it (I have a copy).
4.  [Physics of Light and Waves](http://optics.byu.edu/textbook.aspx) by Justin Peatross and MichaelWare. You can also  buy a printed copy which covers the printing [here](http://www.lulu.com/content/393488)

5.  [Electromagnetic Field Theory](http://www.plasma.uu.se/CED/Book/) by Bo Thidé

6.  [Scattering, Absorption and Emission of Light by Small Particles](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/~crmim/publications/book_2.pdf) by Micheal I Mishchenko, Larry D. Travis,  and Andrew A. Lacis available at their [website](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/books.html)

7.  [](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/books.html)[Frederick Wooten, Optical Properties of Solids, Academic Press, New York, 49, (1972).](http://www.lrsm.upenn.edu/~frenchrh/download/0208fwootenopticalpropertiesofsolids.pdf) This book is shared on Dr. Roger French website and focuses on dielectrics of metals.
