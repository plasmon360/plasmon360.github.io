It demonstrates the propagation of electromagnetic energy in hexagonal array of silver nanorods due to plasmonic coupling. The source is offset from the center and the energy is propagated in an interesting snake like pattern. For more details about this kind of propagation,Â  look at the article [(W.M Saj, Optics Express, Vol 13, 13, 2005)](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-13-13-4818).
